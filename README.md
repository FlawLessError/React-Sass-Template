# React & sass template 

- Made to make it easier to write complex scss function which helps to make the app much faster!
- It uses 7 - 1 patterns (slightly modified to meet my needs!)
- React-router-dom is also added!
- Future-proof CSS! **postcss-preset-env** compiles modern syntax **CSS** into backward compatible code for older devices!
